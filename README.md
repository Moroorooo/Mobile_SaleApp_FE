# Note:
- In app/src/main/Constants.java we have a constant called `BASE_URL` which is the base url for the API. 
- You need to deploy your api and fill in the `BASE_URL` constant with the url of your deployed api.
- You can use the below BASE_URL for testing purpose. But it may not work in the future. So, it is recommended to deploy your own api.

```
public class Constants {
    public static final String BASE_URL = "https://prmprojectfpt.azurewebsites.net/";
}
```
